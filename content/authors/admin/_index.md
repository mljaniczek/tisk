I am a PhD student at UMass Amherst, where I am focused on using machine learning methods on biological classification problems. I am a member of [Raji Balasubramanian's](https://raji-lab.github.io/) lab. I previously  received my MS in Biostatistics from Columbia University, and worked at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for several years.
